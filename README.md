# Daily  Mini Projects

## About This Repository
This repository contains a collection of small and simple  projects that I build daily to strengthen my core programming skills.

Each project focuses on practicing and applying fundamental concepts such as:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Basic Data Structures
- Control flow and logic building
- Clean and readable Java code

The main goal of this repository is to maintain consistency in coding while improving problem-solving and Java fundamentals through hands-on practice.

## How This Repository Is Organized
Each day has its own Markdown file which includes:
- A short description of the project
- The programming  code
- The concepts used


This approach allows me to track my daily progress and build a visible history of continuous learning.

## Why This Repo Exists
Instead of working on one large complex project, this repository focuses on many small projects.  
This helps in:
- Building strong fundamentals
- Practicing coding every day
- Creating a visible and consistent GitHub contribution history
- Demonstrating steady improvement over time

---

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Python
- Markdown (for documentation and code presentation)

---

## Progress
New mini projects are added daily as part of a long-term learning and consistency challenge.
