# Simple Python Project – Day 10

## About
This project is part of my daily Python practice routine.
It focuses on understanding how functions and loops work together to solve a simple problem.
The idea is to strengthen logic building and write clean, readable Python code while practicing consistently.

This project avoids complexity and instead emphasizes clarity and correct usage of core concepts.

## Python Code

```python
# Day 10: Count vowels in a given string

def count_vowels(text):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    count = 0

    for char in text:
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1

    return count


sentence = "Learning Python every day"
vowel_count = count_vowels(sentence)

print("Number of vowels:", vowel_count)
