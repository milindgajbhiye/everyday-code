# Simple Python Project – Day 8

## About
This project marks the start of my daily Python practice.
It focuses on applying basic programming concepts such as:

- Functions
- Conditional logic
- Clean and readable code

The goal is consistency and strengthening Python fundamentals through small projects.

## Python Code

```python
# Day 8: Check whether a number is positive, negative, or zero

def check_number(num):
    if num > 0:
        print("The number is positive")
    elif num < 0:
        print("The number is negative")
    else:
        print("The number is zero")


check_number(10)
